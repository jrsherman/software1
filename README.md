Software project for St. Edwards University. Software team was tasked with developing a Saas with autonomous cars. The website created
picked up individuals and ferried them to their destinations. Google maps was used for this project. 

Unfortunatly the google maps service used for this project has now gone to a payed service. This means the website is now broken.
There is a demo section on this website that takes the client through a video of how the service worked.
